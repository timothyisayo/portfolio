    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
      <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Ajewole Timothy Ayomide</strong>, a passionate and driven programmer. I began my coding journey in <strong>SS3</strong> and have since grown into a versatile developer.</p>
      
      <p>Over the years, I've become proficient in a variety of programming languages including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML & CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>C & C++</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>And more emerging technologies</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I primarily use <strong>VS Code</strong> as my development environment and constantly explore new frameworks, libraries, and tools to sharpen my skills.</p>

      <p>My interests go beyond front-end development. I am deeply invested in <strong>Back-end development</strong>, building robust systems, and <strong>ethical hacking</strong> to understand security vulnerabilities and create safer applications.</p>

      <p>My journey is one of learning, building, and exploring. I love turning ideas into real applications and solving problems creatively with code.</p>

      <p>I'm committed to continuous improvement, learning new languages, and contributing to projects that make a difference. My goal is to become a full-stack developer capable of designing secure, efficient, and elegant solutions.</p>

      <p>Let's create amazing things together!</p>
